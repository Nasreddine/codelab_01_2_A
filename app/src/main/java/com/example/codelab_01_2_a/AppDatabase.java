 *     The class must be annotated with a @Database annotation that includes an entities array that lists all of the data entities associated with the database.
 *     The class must be an abstract class that extends RoomDatabase.
 *     For each DAO class that is associated with the database, the database class must define an abstract method that has zero arguments and returns an instance of the DAO class.
